Errors
Title "Basic Configuration" in "Control Panel - Settings" is reported in the labels resource file as two independent words.
When the words get translated to Spanish they appear in inverse order as "Básica configuración".
The right orden in Spanish is "Configuración Básica"
They should be reported as a phrase in one resource entry, as it is done with the title "Advanced settings".

The same happens with the title "Feed configuration", .
